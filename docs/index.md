    - *It is modified to move diagonal with the Q and E keys.*
- [Space to jump](build_webgl_space2jump)
    - *It is modified to slightly shift to the right.*
<!-- - [Space to shoot]()
    - *It is modified to shoot in other directions with the WASD keys.*
- [Load next scene]()
    - **
- [Move camera]()
    - *It is modified to zoom in with the N key and out with the M key.*   -->
